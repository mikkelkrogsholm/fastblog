### Data scientist
I am a full stack senior data scientist at Teradata. I use data to look for creative and new ways to solve our clients problems. There is data all around us and I love it when we show just what kind of insights can be derived from using and combining data in new an innovative ways.

### Open source contributor
I have benefited tremendously from open source software and packages that other people have written. That is why I also try to contribute what I can to the open source community. I currently have authored six official packages for R that are on CRAN and my github has many more unofficial packages.

### Entrepreneur
There are thousands of great ideas and opportunities in the world. I combine new ideas every day in my work as a data scientist: by combining new technologies, new algorithms and new methods. And some of these combinations I even turn in to new companies. That is why I founded 56north and Turbolex on the side.

### Political scientist
Society is fascinating. Especially the political part. Traditionally trained as a political scientist I apply my data science and entrepreneurial skillset to political issues. I collect data and write analysis and I help political candidates during election campaigns.

### Public Speaker
I cannot shut up about the stuff I do. So I often speak at meetups and conferences on my ideas and on new ways of doing things.

### Festival lover
I love music, concerts and festivals. I attend a lot of them... A lot. I have also combined my love for data with my love for festivals: I head the data science team at Smukfest (Denmarks second largest festival). We spin up servers, docker containers, algorithms and dashboards that hum away while the music is playing providing valuable insights to the festival management.
